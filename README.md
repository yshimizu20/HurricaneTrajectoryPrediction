# HurricaneTrajectoryPrediction

## Sources of Data (Mike's Notes)
Images:
- Hurricane Satellite (HURSAT) Data by NOAA: Images of hurricanes 1978-2016 in netCDF filetype with the eye of the hurricane as the center of the image. **This remains the most consistent source of satllite imgaery on tropical storms.**
  - https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/hursat/

Non-image information:
- HURDAT2: Information on wind speed, pressure, time stamps, location
  - https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat

Potential sources that need more investigating:
- Comprehensive Large Array-Data Stewardship System (CLASS): Database of continous satellite imagery. Times can be restricted to hurricane dates, but at the risk of inconsistent formatting due to different satellites
